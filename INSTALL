Installing on UNIX/BSD/Linux
=============================

Installing from CPAN:
---------------------

$ cpan XML::XSH2

as root or 

$ sudo cpan XML::XSH2

as normal user.

Installing from the distribution tar-ball or CVS
------------------------------------------------

Follow the instructions on http://xsh.sourceforge.net/download.html

Requirements:
-------------

o Perl version >= 5.8.0
o libxml2 and libxslt libraries (http://xmlsoft.org)
  (available on majority of recent Linux distributions)

The following CPAN modules are required (these requirements are
automatically resolved by the cpan installer and are also bundled with
the tar-ball distribution).

  IO::Scalar
  Term::ReadLine::Perl
  Parse::RecDescent          (>=1.80)
  XML::LibXML::Common        (>=0.13)
  XML::LibXML                (>=1.62)
  XML::LibXSLT               (>=1.62)
  XML::LibXML::Iterator  
  XML::XUpdate::LibXML       (>=0.6.0)
  XML::SAX::Writer           (>=0.44)
  XML::Filter::DOMFilter::LibXML

For the full list of dependences, see
http://xsh.sourceforge.net/requirements.html

Installing on Windows
=====================

XSH2 runs also on Microsoft Windows with Active Perl 5.8
(http://www.activestate.com) with some limitations:

  o the TAB-completion does not work in windows console
  o output redirection feature does not work and is disabled

A bundle of packages for installation using the ActivePerl "Perl
Package Manager" can be obtained from
http://xsh.sourceforge.net/download.html.

Another possibility for running XSH2 on Win32 is to use some POSIX
environment such as Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/). In that case,
installation instructions for Unix/Linux apply and all features should
work as on UNIX.
