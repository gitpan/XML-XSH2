  well-balanced chunk)

- XPATH search and XML listing of nodes matched with XPATH

- XPATH-based conditional statements, while statement

- foreach statement allowing usage of relative XPATH expressions

- command output filtering with unix pipe, for example
  xsh> list //word | grep [A-Z] | less 
  to read a list all word elements containing chars from [A-Z] in less

- use of system commands (!ls) like in ftp

- XSLT transformation

- validation
